This is a personal project, that covers the need for a faster and more reliable,
updating process by email, when urgent consignment is required between 2 warehouses.
It uses the logged Outlook account to send the emails.

### BUGS:
* When clicked, the voucher label field, positions the cursor to the middle, thus
makining it unresponsive to input. A crude solution is to press the "Home" button.

## v-0.0.0
*     Except the unfilled email dict's and lists, for security reasons, 
      everything is ready for this application to run in a "Windows" enviroment.

## v-0.0.1
*     A logger has been added.
*     The gui can be executed on a "linux" enviroment, without an Import error.
      All the subsequent errors, since is designed for a "Windows" enviroment 
      will be logged.
